# RKI Data Diff

Shell scripts to get a minimal set of SQL commands for persistent yet efficient storage of RKI data for COVID19. This is a copy of the [official repository in the *DFKI* namespace](https://github.com/DFKI/RKI-Data-Diff), where additional information can be found. The repository at hand in the *fnogatz* name is just used to host a [daily updated dump](https://github.com/fnogatz/RKI-Data-Diff/raw/dump/rki_csv.sql.gz) of the resulting SQL database in its [`dump` branch](https://github.com/fnogatz/RKI-Data-Diff/tree/dump).
